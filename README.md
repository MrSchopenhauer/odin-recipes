# odin-recipes

Current project is part of The Odin Project 
Here I am going to test all my understanding of git 
Maybe, just for now, this README will help like a pseudocode file 

First and foremost, every website needs a index page 
Then the task is to create a recipes page with links to all kind of recipes and images on the web
I will use an actual recipes book from my university about recipes that are typical in my region
Also, I will use its distribution, something alike a digital version of this book! This sounds amazing! c:
